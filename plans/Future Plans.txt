CheckList of all Future Plans will be written here and then transferred to build version to develop :D

FUTURE PLANS


Entering a password somewhere so you get access to certain commands that you dont have access to.

Time passed and time remaining commands to be displaying in hours and 
minutes and seconds if > an hour and continue for other times

Be able to assign shortcuts to commands in settings, as many as the user wishes.

A stopwatch command so that the program behaves like a stop watch rather than just a timer...
even tho the program is meant for being a timer lol.

When fartnoises is put to the right number, the program will make fartnoises at random times :DDD

When c = 2 is typed in settings, the user is told, "Oh wow you have found some gem of a command that 
was first used during first stage of the program to test whether reading files and backup class worked"

Program sends what time it is every set time from settings (like every minute it tells time passed or
remaining time).

"/changelog versions" will list all the versions of the program
"/changelog 7.10" would list what changed in that specific version.
--->>> /changelog is automatically done using plans folder :) <<<<-----------
for example "/changelog 7.10" would search in the plans.txt folder for it :D

All help guides for each command should be written in a text file

Add a system of having several different timer setups for default time like do "start studyingSession" which will
start the timing app with the time, unit and sound based on the profile for "studyingSession"


Completed Plans
-Sound played when times up. This can be an option in settings.
-/about explaining what the program does.
-/stop the timer and can start again.
-/quit command to do close the entire program
-The program should not stop when the warning GUI is closed.
